# Advent of Code 2024 in Nix

This is one of the most cursed yet fun things I have ever done. Normal people use nix for deploying & configuring software. Idiots like me try to use it for a task it wasn't designed for. Thank god nix has a good enough set of built-in functions (it even features a sorting algorithm!).

# Current progress

Not all days were solved using nix yet, since I didn't come up with this brilliant idea right away.

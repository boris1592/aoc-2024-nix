# Advent of Code 2024 in Nix

This is one of the most cursed yet fun things I have ever done. Normal people use nix for deploying & configuring software. Idiots like me try to use it for a task it wasn't designed for. Thank god nix has a good enough set of built-in functions (it even features a sorting algorithm!).

# Current progress

Ain't no way I'm solving day 9 in a purely functional language. It was a mess even in an imperative language.
